# Structure_from_motion_project
This is my Perception project for my NYU Robot perception class FALL 2020 <br><br>
It is a Structure From Motion (SFM) project using a combination of six cameras positioned on various parts of a simple robot model.<br>
The robot moves through a city model and creates an SFM representation of the city model.<br>
